During the first week, my group and I toured our lab and got to see what we will be using in the future for our project. I took a placement test to see where I was, in terms of my knowledge on coding which I knew I wasnt going to score high because I have no knowledge in coding.
Took a 101 course for coding and I learned so much from it, its fun but I doubt I will change my major to Computer Science. I created my blog page today, I'm excited to see everything that I will accomplish and learn during my time here.
