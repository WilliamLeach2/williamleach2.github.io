 we met our high school teachers, Mark and Dominique. We also showed them NASA Giovanni and continued to chart data to identify PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 in our various locations in Baltimore, Maryland. My coordinates are in Southeast Baltimore. We're dividing it up into regions to see which locations, wealthy or low income, have higher air pollution.
 We took a field trip to NASA. They told us about what was going on with NASA. They demonstrated how they were tracking aerosols over time and how they affected our atmosphere and Earth's temperature. They told us that they were injecting aerosols into the atmosphere to counteract global warming. They also showed us their massive computer, which has really noisy fans because they work so hard. The fans are used to keep the computers from overheating.
