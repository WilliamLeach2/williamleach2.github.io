This week, me and my team were finally able to release our helium balloon in
the air to collect data of air Pollution in Baltimore, MD. We release from the
top of the roof of the old science building on Morgans campus. We were also
able to finally fly the drone to collect data of the air pollution as well. This
was the best part of week flying drones is fun.
