This week was I learn a lot more coding and I would say im figuring out how it works now. Still it is a lot but once you start learning it, things start training. I also learned how to use NASA Giovanni software which helps them seem data from all over the globe on how the quailty of Air was over the years. I also learn a new thing called Spatialtemporal Dimension. It refers to space and time and this is something that NASA looks at for the lots of reasons including see the Air polution over time.Me and team made a presentation on the new things we learned and had to record it. Coding is very tiring but its nice knowing I can pick up new skills.
