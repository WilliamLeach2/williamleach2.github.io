This study aims to ascertain the
impact of air pollution on human health. It
identified the most dangerous molecules such as
particulate matter with 2.5 Microns, NO2, etc.
Unlike other pollutants, PM 2.5 gets absorbed into
the bloodstream and cannot be removed easily
once it enters the respiratory system due to its
small size. These pollutants from fossil fuels
contribute to respiratory health problems, with
asthma being a leading cause of death, affecting
over 300 million people annually. (WHO,2023)
Asthma is predominant in low-income and
minority communities, with Baltimore having
nearly three times more cases than any other
county in Maryland. We employed satellite
technology and machine learning techniques to
quantify the correlation between air pollution and
respiratory diseases. Pollution data from NASA
Giovanni and asthma data from selected hospitals
were imported into an AI/ML environment using
Python for analysis. Using machine learning
algorithms, we determined the correlation between
air pollution and respiratory diseases. Our
findings indicate a strong relationship between air
pollution and respiratory diseases in three of the
four zones sampled.
